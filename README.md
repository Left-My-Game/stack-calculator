# Stack Calculator
Calculate how many stacks and semi-stacks you need for a build, or anything you want, in Minecraft!

To use, just insert the whole number you need for the build, click the stack size, by default it is set to 64, click on generate and it will tell you how many stacks you need! For example, if you put in 103 items, it will output 1 stack, and 39 items!
